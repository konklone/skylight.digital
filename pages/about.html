            Skylight was founded in 2016. We're currently made up of X people and one ferret.
            We're working hard to maintain disciplined growth while at the same time cultivating
            an incredible culture. Our headquarters is in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chapel+Hill,+NC/@35.9209387,-79.109331,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89acc31c216e7ea7:0x7f03bae00443e4cb!8m2!3d35.9131996!4d-79.0558445" target="_blank">Chapel Hill, North Carolina</a>,
            but we're a distributed and remote-friendly team. A lot of our client work
            originates from Washington DC.
          </p>

          <p>
            We're impact junkies who are driven to create better outcomes for the public through
            great government digital services. We're also engineers, developers, designers,
            product managers, consultants, writers, speakers, inventors, roboticists, gamers,
            authors, entrepreneurs, parents, and more. Such a diverse team always gives us a
            unique perspective on things.

          <p>
            We're certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) as a <a href="https://www.sba.gov/contracting/government-contracting-programs/hubzone-program" target="_blank">
            Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone)</a> company. This special SBA designation
            means we're committed to revitalizing local communities through job creation.
            In turn, we're granted privileged access to federal government contract opportunities,
            including up to $4M per contract award.
          </p>

          <p>
            To maintain our HUBZone status, 35% of our employees must be located in
            <a href="https://www.sba.gov/contracting/government-contracting-programs/hubzone-program/hubzone-maps" target="_blank">
            one of the nearly 20,000 HUBZone areas across the country</a>. Of that 35%, the greatest
            number of people must be concentrated in our “principal office” location, which is in
            Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The remaining percentage of people are free to live
            in whatever HUBZone locale they prefer. Depending on how people are distributed
            across HUBZones, what qualifies as the greatest concentration in Chapel Hill
            could be a majority or plurality.
