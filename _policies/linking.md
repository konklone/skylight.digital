## Links to third-party sites

We include links to information created and maintained by third-parties. When you click a link to a website, the privacy and security policies of that website apply.

We choose links that align to our mission of making government work in a digital world. Also, if we have a formal relationship with organizations or businesses, we may link to their sites.

The inclusion of links is not intended to assign importance to those sites or to the information contained on those sites. Regardless of content that we link to from our sites or our social media accounts, we do not endorse the content, operators, products, or services of such sites unless explicitly noted otherwise. We link to other websites solely for your convenience and education. We cannot assume any responsibility for the content, operation, or policies of other websites.

We will not link to any website that exhibits hate, bias, or discrimination.

## Linking to skylight.digital

We encourage and permit links to the content on our website. However, we are an organization that is committed to the highest ethics and standards, both in fact and appearance. Unless you’ve received our express written consent, the linking should not: (a) suggest that we promote or endorse any third party’s causes, ideas, political campaigns, websites, products, or services; nor (b) use our protected intellectual property (for example, copyrighted information, logo); nor (c) use our content for commercial or fundraising purposes. We reserve the right to withdraw permission for any link at any time.
Removal of links

You agree that, should we request the deletion of a link to skylight.digital that is within your control, you will delete the link promptly. If you would like us to remove a link to your website that is included on skylight.digital, please contact us via email at <a href="mailto:hello@skylight.digital">hello@skylight.digital</a>. Note that unless you have a legal right to demand removal, such removal will be at our discretion.

## Future changes

If we decide to change this policy, we will update the modification date below.
