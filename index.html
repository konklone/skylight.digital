            Every day millions of people &mdash; from veterans to immigrants &mdash;
            depend on government services to fulfill their needs. But too often
            these services are delivered using outmoded policies, practices,
            and technologies, resulting in frustrating user experiences and
            inefficient use of taxpayer dollars.

            Enter Skylight, a HUBZone-certified digital consultancy based out of
            Chapel Hill, North Carolina. We’re the founders behind successful startups
            inside and outside of government, including 18F and TalkTo.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our mission is to make government work in a digital world using
            design, technology, and procurement.

            To succeed in today’s public-service environment, you need to think
            and be digital. But getting there often requires fundamental practice,
            culture, and technology change. And that means institutionalizing modern
            disciplines such as human-centered design, lean-agile engineering, data science,
            and modular contracting.
          </p>

          <p>
            We offer services in a number of areas to accelerate your journey to
            becoming a digital-first agency: Digital Services Delivery, Digital Procurement,
            and Digital Transformation.
          </p>

          <p>
            These services are designed not only to deliver results, but to also
            transfer our knowledge of modern principles and practices to you.
            To facilitate this learning process, we employ a unique practice called
            embedded instructional design. Even further, <a href="/guilds">our guilds</a> (communities of practice)
            make all of our delivery assets (for example, methodologies) completely free, open,
            and accessible to you.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>How we work with you</strong> is as important as what we work on together.

            As a company, we may be new, but we bring a wealth of individual
            and team experience. We co-founded and scaled 18F, built and sold
            technology startups, created standards that power the internet, and saved
            the federal government from hundreds of millions in unnecessary tech costs.

            We’re eager, excited, and honored to see what we can do for you.
