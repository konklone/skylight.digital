          Every day millions of people &mdash; from veterans to immigrants &mdash;
          depend on government services to fulfill their needs. But too often
          these services are delivered using outmoded policies, practices,
          and technologies, resulting in frustrating user experiences and
          inefficient use of taxpayer dollars.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our mission is to make government work in a digital world using design,
          technology, and procurement.

          To succeed in today's public-service environment, you need to think
          and be digital. But getting there often requires fundamental practice,
          culture, and technology change. And that means institutionalizing modern
          disciplines such as human-centered design, lean-agile engineering, data science,
          and modular contracting.

        <p>
          Our services are designed to <em>accelerate</em> your journey to becoming a
          digital-first agency.

        <p>
          From complex user interactions to entangled technologies to entrenched
          institutional habits, these are just a few of the many challenges that
          government must solve in order to deliver great public digital services.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prior to Skylight, we founded and scaled 18F, built and sold technology
          startups, created standards that power the internet, and saved the federal
          government from hundreds of millions in unnecessary tech costs.

        <p>
          Our experience speaks volumes about what we can do for you.
