    Transparency expectations are changing. As a result, organizations need a radical
    new way to engage with their employees, customers, executives, investors, and other
    key stakeholders.

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    Sean Johnson led the OpenCompany development team to create an open-source,
    digital transparency platform for organizations. Referred to as "GitHub for the rest of
    your organization," it simplifies how leaders share key business information such as
    strategic objectives, performance results, and finances with internal and external
    stakeholders. By making this information open, accessible, and interactive, the
    platform enables organizations to align and engage stakeholders in ways that inspire
    trust, new ideas, and a shared sense of purpose and ownership. In the coming months,
    Sean and the team will be transitioning the platform with a redesign and rebranding.
